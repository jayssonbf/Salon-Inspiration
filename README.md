# Project's Description
- Project's goal

The goal of this project was to find a sponsor who wanted to participate in the development of a system for his/her business.

The requirements documentation that were created are listed below:

	Business Requirements Specification (BRS)
	Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
	Software Requirements Document (SRD)
	Requirements Elicitation
	Requirements Analysis
	Requirements Specification
	Requirements Validation


- Business's purpose

Salon Inspiration is a full-service beauty salon dedicated to consistently providing high customer satisfaction by rendering excellent service, quality products, and furnishing an enjoyable atmosphere at an acceptable price/value relationship. We maintain a friendly, fair, and creative work environment, which respects diversity, ideas, and hard work.

The hair salon currently uses a manual procedure to deal with its management processes. Its customers do not have a proper way to make appointments; other than make a call, send a message, or visit the Salon premise. The salon owner, employees, and customers need to keep reminders on their mobiles over appointments. The salon owner and her employees maintain a diary to note down the appointment details and transaction information. The transactions are categorized into daily and periodic transactions. The daily transactions include recording payments, appointments, and customer information. The periodic transactions include recording new product information, the amount of stock added, and the amount of stock that has been used. The information recorded during daily and periodic transactions are needed as a reference record used during stock check, and analysis of service sales. The salon relies on the non-computerized system to record those transactions and to manage appointments. 

The product goal is to provide a fully equipped system that contains a set of features that facilitate the businessâ€™s needs such as tracking inventory coming in, managing appointments, billing, and payments among others. Also, a large database to store employee data, client data, and sales.
